# MCP-Servers

This repository contains links and references to various Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers i use in my own projects. Each MCP server provides specialized capabilities to enhance development workflows, context management, search, automation, and integration.

## MCP Servers Overview

### [Context7 MCP Server](https://github.com/upstash/context7)
A context management server designed to store, retrieve, and manage contextual data for AI and automation workflows. Enables efficient context sharing between agents and applications. I use this as my primary knoledge base when I need an Model to reference documentation. 

### [Brave Search MCP Server](https://brave.com/search/api/guides/use-with-claude-desktop-with-mcp/)
Integrates Brave Search API with MCP, allowing agents to perform real-time web searches and retrieve up-to-date information programmatically. This is what I use when the Context7 fails to yield information. 

### [Sequential Thinking MCP Server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/sequentialthinking)
Implements sequential reasoning and stepwise task execution for AI agents, supporting complex multi-step workflows and decision-making processes.

### [Microsoft Learn Documents MCP Server](https://github.com/microsoftdocs/mcp?tab=readme-ov-file)
Provides access to Microsoft Learn documentation through MCP, enabling automated retrieval and integration of official Microsoft technical resources.

### [Azure MCP Server](https://github.com/Azure/azure-mcp)
Facilitates integration with Microsoft Azure services, allowing MCP agents to interact with Azure APIs for cloud resource management and automation.

### [GitHub MCP Server](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server)
Enables MCP-based automation and data retrieval from GitHub, supporting repository management, issue tracking, and workflow integration.

### [Playwright MCP Server](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp)
Connects Playwright browser automation capabilities to MCP, enabling automated browser testing and web interaction within MCP workflows.

### [Shadcn UI MCP Server](https://github.com/Jpisnice/shadcn-ui-mcp-server)
Integrates Shadcn UI component library management into MCP workflows, enabling automated UI generation, customization, and seamless integration of Shadcn UI components for rapid front-end development.
